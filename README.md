# minecraft-backup-utility
*Simple utility to backup your .minecraft folder. This will backup all your Minecraft worlds, resource-packs, settings, etc.*

**Installation:**

1. Download/Unzip from this repository or use `git clone` command.
2. Run the installation script: `./install-mcbackup.sh`

**Note:**

* This program is designed for Ubuntu Linux (Debian-based). Not sure about other Linux distros. 
* This definitely won't work regularly on Windows/MacOS, but could possibly be modified to work with Windows 10 using WSL2. (as long as you change the folder installation paths certain variables use.)
