# minecraft-backup-utility
*Simple utility to backup your .minecraft folder. This will backup all your Minecraft worlds, resource-packs, settings, etc.*

**Note:**

* This program is designed for Ubuntu Linux (Debian-based). Not sure about other Linux distros. 
* This definitely won't work on Windows/MacOS, but could possibly be modified to work with Windows 10 using WSL2.
