# minecraft-backup-utility
Simple utility to backup your .minecraft folder. This will backup all your Minecraft worlds, resource-packs, settings, etc.
** Note: this program is designed for Linux (Ubuntu/Debian). Not sure about other distros. This definitely won't work on Windows, but could possibly be modified to work with WSL2. Not sure about Mac OS.**
